## Project

**Me Gustas Tú (MGT) Staff Scheduling** — private internal web app for a
restaurant in the Canary Islands. Manager submits employees, requests, and
assigns weekly shifts. Sister app to **MGT Bookings** (separate repo,
separate Firebase project, same UI conventions).

- **Owner / sole developer:** Patryk Zychowicz (pz.zychowicz@gmail.com)
- **Stack:** React 19, Vite, Firebase Realtime Database + Auth, deployed on Vercel
- **Repo:** `github.com/pzzychowicz-blip/megustastu-scheduling` *(to be created)*
- **Live:** `https://megustastu-scheduling.vercel.app/` *(to be created)*
- **Current version:** see `src/App.jsx` → `__APP_SIGNATURE__.version` (single source of truth)
- **Sister project for style/pattern reference:** `github.com/pzzychowicz-blip/megustastu-bookings`

## Locked v1 decisions (session 1 — 2026-05-12)

### Functional
- **Auth:** Manager-only login. One Firebase Auth account = Patryk. No
  staff portal, no custom claims, no Cloud Function.
- **Operating window:** 11:00–23:00 (evening ends at 23:00 to cover close + cleanup).
- **Default shift template** (editable in-app via Settings):

  | Section | Day shift | Evening shift |
  |---|---|---|
  | Front of House | 1 person, 11:00–17:00 (covers Bar + Floor) | 1st 17:00–23:00, 2nd 18:00 or 19:00 – 23:00 (manager picks per day) |
  | Kitchen | 1 person, 11:00–16:00 (covers Chef + Plating + Pot) | 3 people, 16:00–23:00 (Chef, Plating, Pot — one each) |

- **Roles:** Bar, Floor, Chef, Plating, Pot.
- **Day-shift role coverage:** a single person performs all FoH roles
  (day FoH) or all Kitchen roles (day Kitchen). Evening shifts have one
  specific role per person.
- **Slot display order (v0.8.0):** Kitchen Day → Kitchen Evening →
  Front of House Day → Front of House Evening. Same order in the
  schedule grid (`ScheduleGrid.jsx`) and in the PDF export
  (`pdf-export.js`) — both drive off `slotsForDay()`.
- **Evening default roles (v0.8.0):** FoH Evening slot 0/1 → Bar/Floor;
  Kitchen Evening slot 0/1/2 → Chef/Plating/Pot. Slot index ≥ section's
  role count → `defaultRole: null` (manager picks). Existing shift
  records keep their stored role even if empty — only NEW shifts get
  the prefill.
- **Employee profile fields:** name, roles (multi-select from the 5),
  fixed-days toggle (default OFF; when ON, lists the contractual workdays),
  shift preference (day / evening / either), working days per week
  (v0.12.0; 1..7, default 5).
- **Work pattern:** 5 working days → 2 days off as the default; v0.12.0
  makes this per-employee via `workingDaysPerWeek` (1..7, default 5).
  The off-days CAN be split (e.g. Mon+Tue work, Wed+Thu off, Fri–Sun
  work). Enforced by the generator only — manual edits can override.
- **Requests module:** manager enters all day-off and holiday records on
  staff's behalf (staff communicate via WhatsApp / in person).
- **Export:** PDF in horizontal spreadsheet layout. Available **only when
  the schedule is fully complete** (no empty cells). v0.9.0: evening
  cells render assignee name only (the role is implicit from the row);
  evening row labels show start time only (the end is the close of
  service and was visual noise on the printed sheet). Day rows keep
  the full `start–end` range.
- **Auto-generator (v1.0.0, extended v1.1.0):** **Shipped.** Greedy +
  constraint-aware. Fills empty cells respecting role match, same-day
  strict, workingDaysPerWeek quota, fixedDays gate, opening-days, and
  request conflicts (HARD block). Shift preference is switchable Soft
  (try preferred first, fall back) / Hard (only matching) via the
  Settings → Auto-generator section. Leaves cells empty rather than
  violating rules. **v1.1.0** adds Regenerate mode (smart re-evaluate:
  walks every existing shift, clears any that violate current
  constraints, then runs fill-empty on the survivors). Confirm modal
  exposes both modes side-by-side. Pure algorithm lives in
  `src/lib/generator.js` (no React / Firebase); orchestration in
  `GenerateButton.jsx` + `GenerateConfirmModal.jsx`. Result surfaced
  as an auto-dismissing inline banner above the grid; banner copy
  branches on mode (fill-empty / regenerate / clear).
- **Day-shift required role (v1.1.0):** a section may declare
  `dayRequiredRoles: [role, …]` in `SECTIONS`. When set, an employee
  must hold AT LEAST ONE of those roles to qualify for the section's
  day slot — stricter than the permissive "any of coversRoles" rule.
  `SECTIONS.kitchen.dayRequiredRoles = ["Chef"]`: a Plating-only or
  Pot-only employee cannot lead Kitchen Day. FoH has no
  `dayRequiredRoles` so its day slot keeps the permissive rule (any of
  Bar / Floor). The rule is propagated through `slotsForDay` onto each
  day slot's `requiredRoles` field; both the manual picker
  (ShiftFormModal) and the auto-generator (generator.js → roleMatches)
  read from the slot — single rule, two consumers.
- **Clear-shifts button (v1.1.0):** new `<ClearButton>` in the Schedule
  nav bar between Generate and Export-PDF. Opens
  `ClearConfirmModal.jsx` with a scope picker (Whole week / per-open-
  day buttons, each showing the live shift count). Confirm is a red
  destructive button labelled "Clear N shifts". Closed days don't
  appear as scope options.
- **Prior-week fairness (v1.1.0):** the generator's candidate ranking
  factors in last week's shift counts. Sort key changed from
  "specialists → current-week count → name" to "specialists →
  combined (current + prior week) count → name". An employee who
  worked many shifts last week is picked later this week until their
  two-week totals roughly match peers. ScheduleGrid computes
  `priorWeekShifts = shiftsForWeek(shifts, addDays(weekStart, -7))`
  and threads it through `<GenerateButton>` → `generateWeek({
  priorWeekShifts })`. Empty / missing falls back to zero counts —
  the first week of operation has no fairness effect (correctly).
  History window is intentionally short (7 days) — older data could
  push the generator to overcompensate for runs the manager already
  hand-balanced.
- **Weekly shifts summary footer (v1.2.0):**
  `<WeeklyShiftSummary>` renders below the schedule grid's helper
  caption. One compact pill per active employee
  (plus any archived employee still on the week): "Name · N / quota".
  Sort: under-utilization ratio asc (most-under first), then name.
  Visual cues: zero count → muted; under quota → soft accent tint;
  at/over → neutral. Reads from `employees` + `weekShifts` — no new
  state.
- **Shift-preference request type (v1.2.0):** new entry in
  `REQUEST_TYPES` (`key: "shift-preference"`). Constrains an
  employee to ONE dayPart (Day or Evening) on the given dates via a
  new `preferredDayPart: "day" | "evening"` field on the request
  record. `findRequestConflict` is now type-guarded to dayoff /
  holiday only; the new `findShiftPreferenceMismatch` handles the
  dayPart-scoped check. Enforcement: **HARD** in the generator
  (mismatched candidates are rejected, reason `"shift-preference"`)
  and in `clearInvalidShifts` for Regenerate. **SOFT** in the manual
  picker (yellow warning banner, manager judgment wins). The form
  modal renders a Day / Evening segmented control conditionally
  when type === `shift-preference`.
- **At least 2 consecutive days off (v1.2.0):** labor wellness rule.
  `hasConsecutiveDaysOff(employeeId, weekStart, shiftsMap, n=2)` in
  `schedule-logic.js` returns true iff the employee's working
  pattern for the Mon–Sun week has a run of ≥ n consecutive off
  days (closed days count as off). **HARD** in the generator —
  candidate rejected if simulating the assignment would break the
  rule, reason `"no-2-off"`. **HARD** in `clearInvalidShifts` —
  for each employee whose remaining shifts violate, clear
  latest-date shifts until satisfied. **SOFT** in the manual picker
  — yellow warning banner if the chosen employee + this cell would
  break the rule; save still works. No cross-week wrapping
  (Sun ↔ next-Mon doesn't count).
- **Conflict semantics (revised v0.8.0):**
  - **Same-date double-booking is a HARD block.** A single employee
    cannot hold two shifts on the same date (covers day + evening on
    the same Tuesday). Enforced by both the picker filter (the
    employee is hidden from the dropdown) and the save handler
    (refuses with a red banner if state desyncs).
  - **Day-off / holiday request conflicts hide-by-default.** Anyone
    with a covering request is hidden from the picker. A toggle in
    the modal ("Show staff on day off / holiday") restores them and
    re-surfaces the yellow conflict banner — the manager can then
    deliberately override per the v1 "judgment wins" principle.
  - **Role mismatch is a HARD filter.** Evening picker only shows
    employees who hold the slot's role. Day picker shows anyone
    holding any of the section's roles.
  - **Original v1 banner (v0.4.0):** kept and still fires when the
    show-all toggle reveals a request-conflicted assignee.
- **Settings layout (v0.10.0, expanded v1.0.0, renamed v1.3.0):**
  single-open accordion. Section order is Operating time → Display →
  Auto-generator → FoH → Kitchen. Operating time opens by default.
  Per-section dirty dot in headers for Operating time / FoH / Kitchen.
  Display and Auto-generator sections bypass the Save button — their
  toggles auto-save immediately on change because they have no
  validation and their effect is either instant on the grid (Display)
  or consumed on the next generator click (Auto-generator). Clicking
  Save while errors exist force-opens the first section carrying an
  error. v1.3.0 renamed the top section from "Operating hours" to
  "Operating time" (cosmetic; same `openSection === "hours"` key
  internally).
- **Theming model (v0.11.0):** light + dark themes driven by CSS
  custom properties. `:root` in `index.html` holds light values;
  `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides each value for dark. React writes
  `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = "dark"|"light"`; zero
  re-renders on theme flip. Token shape: `S`, `BTN`, `STATUS_COLORS`,
  `ROLE_COLORS` in `constants.js` reference `var(--…)` strings and
  carry no rgba/hex literals. ROLE_COLORS specifically holds RGB
  channel triplets (`"var(--role-bar-rgb)"`) so callers compose
  alpha via `rgba(${rgb}, 0.2)` at the use site.
- **Theme resolution (v0.11.0):** boolean Toggle in Settings → Display.
  When `settings.darkMode === undefined`, follow `prefers-color-scheme`
  live (the `useThemeMode` hook listens for OS changes). When the
  manager flips the toggle, `darkMode` is saved as an explicit boolean
  to `/settings` — once explicit, system pref is ignored. Initial paint
  before React mounts is handled by an inline script in `index.html`
  reading `prefers-color-scheme` so there's no flash of wrong theme.
- **PDF export (v0.11.0):** the PDF renderer keeps the light palette
  regardless of in-app theme. Printed rotas should be ink-economic
  and legible on paper; dark backgrounds on print would waste toner
  and look wrong. `pdf-export.js` never reads CSS vars.
- **Opening days (v0.12.0, per-day-part since v1.3.0):**
  `/settings.openingDays` is a per-weekday object map where each entry
  carries `{ day: bool, evening: bool }`. A weekday is "closed" iff
  both halves are false; "open" iff either is true. Fully-closed days
  disappear from the grid (desktop columns + mobile day-cards) and
  from the PDF export. Cells whose slot's `dayPart` is closed on that
  date render as inert "Closed" placeholders on the desktop grid, get
  filtered out of the mobile day-card slot list, and render as empty
  cells in the PDF. All consumers normalize the raw `/settings`
  value through `normalizeOpeningDays(raw)` in `schedule-logic.js`,
  which also handles the v0.12.0 legacy boolean shape
  (`true` → `{day:true,evening:true}`, `false` →
  `{day:false,evening:false}`). No Firebase write migration — legacy
  docs upgrade lazily next time the manager saves Operating time.
  `visibleWeekDates(weekStart, openingDays)` returns dates with at
  least one open half; `isSlotOpenOnDate(date, slot, openingDays)`
  is the per-cell gate consumed by the grid, PDF, generator worklist,
  generator's `clearInvalidShifts` (`closed-day-part` reason), and
  `isWeekComplete`. Save validation requires ≥1 day part open across
  the week. PDF zebra-stripe column indices stay absolute (2 / 4 / 6
  in the rendered table) — after a closure they fall on alternating
  visible columns rather than specifically Tue / Thu / Sat.
- **Per-employee work pattern (v0.12.0):**
  `employees/{id}.workingDaysPerWeek` is a number 1..7, default 5.
  Off-days are derived (`7 − N`). v0.12.0 stores + displays the
  pattern (segmented control on the edit form with a live
  "N working / M off" helper; `Pattern: N/M` on the roster row).
  It is NOT consumed by any scheduling logic yet — the auto-generator
  (v1.x) is the primary consumer. Legacy employees without the field
  display the default 5 / 2 on read; no Firebase migration.
- **Scheduling priority (v1.3.0):** `employees/{id}.schedulingPriority`
  is a boolean, default false. When true, the auto-generator picks
  that employee before any non-priority employee — it becomes the
  primary sort key in `rankCandidates` (specialists rule, combined
  load, and name only tiebreak within the priority and non-priority
  groups separately). It does NOT affect eligibility — a priority
  employee still has to satisfy role, request, fixedDays, preference,
  same-day strict, quota, and consecutive-off rules. Toggle lives on
  the employee form ("Auto-generator priority"); roster row carries
  a small "Priority" badge. The manual picker (ShiftFormModal) does
  NOT reorder by priority — the manager picks one cell at a time and
  can see priority directly on the employee badge. Legacy employees
  without the field read as `false` (no migration).
- **Schedule grid visual polish (v1.4.0):**
  - **Vertical column rules.** Desktop grid renders a hairline between
    every pair of date columns. Implementation: one grid-spanning
    underlay div per inter-column boundary
    (`gridColumn: <i+2>`, `gridRow: "1 / -1"`, `borderLeft: 1px solid
    var(--hairline)`, `marginLeft: -3` to centre the line in the 6px
    grid gap). Underlay divs are `pointerEvents: none` and painted
    first in source order so cells layer above. Section header rows
    span `gridColumn: "1 / -1"` and so are unaffected. No column
    rules on mobile.
  - **Today-column tint.** A single underlay div with
    `gridColumn: <todayIndex + 2>`, `gridRow: "1 / -1"`,
    `background: var(--accent-tint-soft)`. Translucent cell
    backgrounds let the tint show through. `todayIndex < 0` (today
    outside week / closed) → no underlay. No mobile counterpart this
    round (day-cards stay independent).
- **Generator result details (v1.4.0):** the result banner gains a
  "Details" button (only visible when `summary.unfilledCells` or
  `summary.clearedReasons` is non-empty). Click opens
  `GenerateResultsModal` listing each unfilled cell and (for
  Regenerate) each cleared shift grouped by reason. Human-readable
  labels live in `GENERATOR_REASONS` in `constants.js` — single
  source of truth keyed by the reason codes the generator emits.
  The banner's 5-second auto-dismiss is held while the modal is open
  so the manager can read at leisure; closing the modal resumes the
  countdown. Dismissing the banner (via ×) also closes the modal as
  a safety against stale-state rendering. Clear-button results never
  show "Details" — they carry no reason metadata. Generator's
  `clearInvalidShifts.clear()` was enriched to capture each cleared
  shift's date/employeeId/section/dayPart/slotIndex/slotKey at clear
  time, so the modal can display "Anna — Tue 19, Kitchen Day —
  archived" rows even after the record has been deleted from Firebase.

### Architectural
- React 19 + Vite (NOT CRA, NOT Next), Firebase RTDB + Auth, Vercel
  auto-deploy from `main`.
- Plain JavaScript only. No TypeScript.
- JSX literal syntax (NOT `React.createElement` or `RC`). Vite's
  automatic JSX runtime via `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- No `import React from "react"` — only specific hooks:
  `import { useState, useEffect } from "react"`.
- `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, NEVER `var`.
- Multi-file structure (hooks/, components/, lib/) — not a monolithic file.
- Mandatory Firebase **write-guard pattern** on every write (see below).
- Mandatory Firebase **dev/prod project split** from day one (see below).
- ≤4 simultaneous `backdropFilter: blur()` instances — hard limit.

## Code conventions

### Modern declarations
- Use `const` by default; `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- **Never `var`.** (Bookings project converted 380 vars in a single
  refactor phase; do not repeat that history here — start modern.)

### JSX, not RC
- All JSX uses literal JSX syntax (`<div>...</div>`).
- Do **not** add `import React from "react"` — Vite's automatic JSX
  runtime handles this.
- Import only specific hooks: `import { useState, useEffect } from "react"`.

### Filename rules (hard)
- Any file containing JSX must use the `.jsx` extension.
- Pure-logic hooks/libs use `.js`.
- Vite/oxc rejects JSX in `.js` files at startup. Verify via `npm run build`.

### One unit per file
- One hook per file in `src/hooks/`. Filename matches export (`useXxx.{js,jsx}`).
- One component per file in `src/components/`. PascalCase filename matches export.
- Exception: `atoms.jsx` exports several tightly-coupled primitives together.

### Conditional rendering
- Prefer ternaries: `cond ? <X /> : null`.
- Avoid `cond && <X />` — historical convention from Bookings; reduces a
  class of falsy-render bugs (e.g., `0 && <X />` rendering `0`).

### Boolean controls (locked v0.10.1)
- **Prefer the `Toggle` atom over `<input type="checkbox">`** for any
  boolean setting. The Toggle is iOS-style, the whole row is tappable,
  and it composes its label + helper text consistently.
- Exceptions (where a native checkbox is still fine):
  - Multi-select grids where the manager picks several items at once
    (e.g., role pickers, weekday pickers).
  - Any future native `<form>` integration that submits checkbox
    values.
- When in doubt, default to `Toggle`. The visual language is more
  consistent with the rest of the app and matches the design
  direction (iOS-inspired translucent surfaces).

### Comments
- Heavy commenting is expected — single-developer codebase with long
  context gaps between sessions.
- Section headers use `// ── Name ──...` for grep-ability.
- Phase notes use `// Phase X (vY.Y.Y): ...` at the top of moved blocks.

### Style tokens
- All colours, spacing, button styles, badge styles flow through
  `src/lib/constants.js` exports (`S`, `BTN`, `STATUS_COLORS`, `ROLE_COLORS`).
- Reusable JSX atoms in `src/components/atoms.jsx`: `Overlay`, `Fld`,
  `Section`, `Collapsible` (v0.10.0), `Toggle` (v0.10.0), `TBadge`,
  `mkInp`, `mkBtn`.
- New UI **composes from atoms**, not redefines them.

---

## UI style — matches MGT Bookings

### Aesthetic
- Translucent / glass surfaces, iOS-inspired.
- Card background: `rgba(255,255,255,0.45)`.
- Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.35)`.
- Accent: `#007AFF` (iOS blue).
- Rounded corners: `borderRadius: 12` on inputs / buttons / cards.
- Inset shadows on inputs for depth.

### Layout
- Mobile = full-screen sheet, desktop = centered card for modals.
- Use the `Overlay` atom for every modal — it owns the canonical blur and
  the mobile-vs-desktop branching.

### Performance gotcha — backdrop-filter blur
- `backdropFilter: blur(...)` is expensive. **Hard limit: ≤4 simultaneous
  blur instances visible at once.** The Bookings app had a production
  bug with 51 instances; do not reintroduce. Reuse `Overlay` (which has
  the canonical blur) rather than adding new blurred surfaces.

---

## Critical patterns

### Firebase write-guard pattern — MANDATORY

Every Firebase write must be guarded by a `dataLoaded` ref that flips
`true` only after the initial `onValue` callback returns. Without this,
an effect that fires before Firebase loads can save `[]` over real data.

```js
const shiftsLoaded = useRef(false);

function saveShifts(next, isSilent) {
  if (!shiftsLoaded.current) {
    console.warn("[SAFE] Refused to write — initial read has not completed.");
    if (!isSilent) setWriteWarning("...");
    return;
  }
  if (Array.isArray(next) && next.length === 0
      && firstLoadCount.current !== null && firstLoadCount.current > 0) {
    console.warn("[SAFE] Refused to write empty array.");
    if (!isSilent) setWriteWarning("...");
    return;
  }
  set(ref(db, "shifts"), next).catch(function () {});
}
```

Apply to **every** Firebase write: `shifts`, `employees`, `requests`,
`settings`, `shiftTemplate`. Auto-effects (anything that writes without
direct user action) must pass `isSilent=true` to suppress the
user-facing banner on refusal.

**Origin:** post-v13-deploy data-loss incident in MGT Bookings. The
auto-extend effect fired `saveBookings([])` on mount before `onValue`
returned. Do **not** repeat. Build this pattern in from the first commit.

### Dev/prod Firebase split — from day one

`src/firebase.js` switches configs based on `import.meta.env.DEV`:

- `npm run dev` → DEV project (safe to experiment).
- `npm run build` → PROD project (Vercel uses this).

Both configs are hardcoded in `firebase.js`. Firebase web API keys are
NOT secrets — Database Rules are the actual security layer.

### Single central save path
- Any code path that modifies shifts should pass through a single helper
  (e.g., `shiftsAfterAction(shifts, savedId, isNew)`) so future
  conflict-detection / re-derivation logic has one place to hook into.

---

## Workflow

### Versioning
- Source of truth: `src/App.jsx` → `__APP_SIGNATURE__.version`.
- Propagates to: console boot banner, `window.__MGT_SCHED_BUILD__`,
  Settings → General label.
- Every meaningful change bumps the patch version.
- Schema: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Major/minor only on user-visible feature
  shifts; structural refactors bump patch.

### REFACTOR_LOG.md discipline
- Every version that ships gets an entry in `REFACTOR_LOG.md` at repo root.
- Entries include: date, files changed, behavioural-change status, line
  delta, scope, key design decisions, verification results.

### Trigger phrases (in chat)
- **"give me the deployment version"** — produce a production-ready file
  with Firebase integration, auth, cleanup logic, logout.
- **"give me changelog"** — generate a PDF changelog.
- **"sum up this thread"** — produce a markdown thread summary suitable
  for attaching to the next thread.

### Preview file naming (when iterating before deployment)
- Pattern: `scheduling_v{X}_preview {N}.jsx` (incremented chronologically,
  never overwrite).

### Local preview server — MANDATORY (locked 2026-05-16)

**For any session that touches visual code** (styling, layout, UI tokens,
PDF export, component structure), **start a local dev server at the
beginning of the session and keep it running throughout.** Patryk reviews
changes against the running URL after each iteration; without it, every
tweak has to be re-explained from a code diff instead of seen.

Default flow:
1. `npm run dev` (in the background) — Vite dev server on
   `http://localhost:5173/` (or 5174 if 5173 is in use). Hot-reloads on
   every save, so Patryk sees changes immediately without rebuilds.
   **Hits the DEV Firebase project** (`megustastu-bookings-dev`) — the
   safe sandbox. DO NOT default to `npm run preview` (which hits PROD)
   — writes during inspection would mutate live restaurant data.
2. Tell Patryk the URL whenever you start the server. Vite's HMR means
   no manual rebuild after edits — most changes appear in <1s.
3. If a change doesn't appear, suggest a hard-refresh (⌘⇧R).

Why DEV, not PROD:
- DEV is the sandbox by design. PROD writes during inspection are
  dangerous — one accidental Save click could mutate live employee /
  request / shift data.
- DEV has its own Auth user pool. The DEV user (Authentication →
  Users in the `megustastu-bookings-dev` Firebase Console) MUST be
  set up before any visual session, with Email/Password sign-in
  enabled under Authentication → Sign-in method. If sign-in returns
  `auth/invalid-credential`, fix the DEV project before proceeding —
  do NOT pivot to PROD as a shortcut.

When `npm run preview` is appropriate (rare):
- Verifying the production build output specifically (chunk splitting,
  bundle size sanity, prod-only edge cases). Tell Patryk explicitly
  it's hitting PROD and that he must not click Save / assign / mutate.

When to skip the server entirely:
- Pure logic / hook changes with no visual surface (e.g., editing
  schedule-logic.js helpers, pdf-export.js internals that don't
  change output, persistence write-guards).
- Doc-only commits (CLAUDE.md, REFACTOR_LOG.md).
- Session begins with a planning / exploration question — start the
  server once code edits begin.

PDF export caveat: PDF generation runs entirely in the browser
(jsPDF), so it works the same on DEV as on PROD. The schedule data
will be DEV data (sparse / empty unless seeded), so a complete-week
test export may require seeding employees + shifts in DEV first.

### Deployment

**Rule (locked 2026-05-14): one version per branch.** Every version bump
ships as its own branch with its own PR — never bundle multiple
versions on a single branch. If a previous PR is still open when work
on the next version is ready to start, wait for it to merge first.

Standard flow:

1. After the previous PR merges, `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`.
2. Create a new branch off fresh `main` — naming convention
   `feat/v{X.Y.Z}-{short-slug}` for features (`feat/v0.9.0-polish`),
   `chore/{slug}` for non-version changes (docs, refactors, tooling).
3. Make the edits in `src/`.
4. Bump `__APP_SIGNATURE__` in `src/App.jsx`.
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` file-structure block + locked-decisions if the
   change affects either.
6. Prepend an entry to `REFACTOR_LOG.md`.
7. `npm run build` — must succeed; note the main-bundle gz size delta.
8. Commit with descriptive message
   (e.g. `v0.9.0 — Polish (PDF trim, specialists-first picker, role-pills toggle)`).
9. `git push -u origin <branch>`.
10. `gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "..." --body "..."`.
11. Patryk reviews + merges. Vercel auto-deploys from `main`.
12. Confirm the console boot banner / `window.__MGT_SCHED_BUILD__.version`
    matches the new version on production.
13. **Sync the local working folder** (locked v0.10.1):
    `git -C /Users/patrykzychowicz/Desktop/megustastu-scheduling pull --ff-only origin main`.
    Keeps the local checkout always on `main` so `npm run dev` and any
    manual file inspection reflect the shipped state without manual
    hunting. The local folder never rides a feature branch — branches
    live only in the `.claude/worktrees/` subfolders.

**Why one-per-branch:**
- Reverts are surgical — a single bad version reverts cleanly without
  also yanking unrelated work.
- PR review stays scoped — reviewer doesn't need to keep two
  versions' design decisions in their head at once.
- Vercel preview URLs map 1:1 to versions, making smoke-tests on the
  preview deployment unambiguous.

**`gh` CLI** is installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh` (not on `$PATH` —
use absolute path or add `/opt/homebrew/bin` to your shell rc).

## Stability rule

If Patryk requests something that leads to future instability or bad
architecture, **push back and suggest a better approach**. Do not blindly
follow instructions. Patryk is a self-taught beginner and explicitly
expects this kind of pushback.

## Clarifications

If anything is unclear, **ask before implementing**. Do not assume
missing details.

## Conversation budget

After ~25 messages in a single chat, remind Patryk to start a new
conversation. Carry context forward via a `"sum up this thread"` summary
attached to the next thread.

## Gotchas and constraints

| Issue | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Backdrop-filter performance | ≤4 simultaneous `backdropFilter: blur()` instances |
| Empty-array writes | Refused by save guards if `firstLoadCount > 0`; design around this |
| `formRef.current` vs `form` | Event handlers read the ref; renders read the state |
| Firebase free plan | No automatic backups. Don't rely on Firebase rollback. |
| DEV writes to PROD | Prevented by the `firebase.js` env switch — never bypass it |
| Day-shift role storage | `role: null` on day-shift slots; one person covers all section roles |
| PDF export gating | Only enabled when every cell in the week is filled |

## Out of scope (v1)

- **Staff portal / per-staff logins** — manager-only auth.
- **Multi-tenancy** — single-restaurant app; no plans to generalise.
- **Native mobile app** — web-only; mobile handled by responsive layout.
- **Time tracking / clock in–out** — separate concern.
- **Payroll** — separate concern.
- **Shift swaps between staff** — manager edits manually for v1.
- **Booking-volume-aware staffing** — future integration with MGT
  Bookings, not v1.
- **Notifications (email / SMS / push)** — future.
- **Tests** — no test suite; verification is via manual QA + AST audits.
- **TypeScript** — plain JavaScript only.
